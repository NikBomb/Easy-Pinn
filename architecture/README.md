# Architecture

This folder contains:
- ADRs (Architecture Decision Records): stable decisions and rationale
- Per-spec architecture notes: `<SPEC-ID>-arch.md`

## ADR naming
- `ADR-0001-title.md`

## When to write an ADR
Write an ADR when you decide something that will likely matter later, e.g.:
- a new module boundary
- a config format
- an experiment/results layout
- a long-lived dependency choice
