# Project Status

This file provides a high-level view of feature progress.
It is the primary input for feature selection when the user does not specify a spec.

---

## In progress
(Actively being worked on; highest priority)
- None

---

## Draft
(Planned, not yet started)
- None

---

## Complete
(Finished features; reference only)
- SPEC-0006: Problem 0 PINN baseline
- SPEC-0006A: Adam optimizer and Problem 0 training check
- SPEC-0007: Problem 0 full-domain app with results export

---

## Notes
- Prefer finishing **In progress** specs before starting new ones.
- Large specs should be split into sub-specs (A, B, C).
- If no spec is In progress, pick the lowest-numbered Draft spec and propose moving it to In progress.
