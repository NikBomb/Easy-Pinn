# Project Status

This file provides a high-level view of feature progress.
It is the primary input for feature selection when the user does not specify a spec.

---

## In progress
(Actively being worked on; highest priority)

- SPEC-0003: PINN heat equation baseline
- SPEC-0004A: Experiment runner CLI

---

## Draft
(Planned, not yet started)

- SPEC-0004B: Experiment runner config format
- SPEC-0004C: Results tracking and metrics
- SPEC-0005: Training stability diagnostics

---

## Complete
(Finished features; reference only)

- SPEC-0001: Project scaffold
- SPEC-0002: Basic PINN template

---

## Notes
- Prefer finishing **In progress** specs before starting new ones.
- Large specs should be split into sub-specs (A, B, C).
- If no spec is In progress, pick the lowest-numbered Draft spec and propose moving it to In progress.
